# Middlewares is concept of Express

# Order of middlewares is matter

# In Node.js, \_\_dirname is always the directory in which the currently executing script resides

# By contrast, . gives you the directory from which you ran the node command in your terminal window (i.e. your working directory)

# The exception is when you use . with require(). The path inside require is always relative to the file containing the call to require.

# If we assigned variable to an object, this variable is the reference to this object.

# Query string 127.0.0.1:3000/api/v1/tours?duration=5&page=7. And req.query returns { duration: '5', page: '7' }

# If schema was changed, data previously persisted in DB still keep all the old fields, except new ones created with new schema
